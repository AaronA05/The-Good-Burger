# Good Burger

## Good burger is a fun web application using MySQL to manage user burger orders. For this application I created an ORM to read and update the database. This application also utilizes a MVC structure.  

### To run on your own machine, clone or download the repository, npm install for dependencies, make updates to connection.js file for MySQL connection, run npm server.js, and open browser to localhost: 3500.
